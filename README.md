# MotorisedVolumeKnob

Arduino sketch to control an ALPS RK16812MG0AF (or similar) motorised potentiometer via an L298N (or similar) H-Bridge, TSOP1838 receiver (or similar 38kHz IR demodulator), and NEC protocol IR remote control.

This repo is very much a work in progress. More documentation (both here and in-code) will be available once I get everything working.
For now, I would recommend you look into IRLib2 instead.
