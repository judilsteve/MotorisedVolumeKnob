This spacer is designed to go between the potentiometer's front face and the faceplate of the enclosure. The spacer reduces the gap between the knob and the faceplate on the outside of the enclosure. It is 3mm thick in the file here, which is as thick as you can print it before you run out of thread on the outside of the faceplate for securing the locking nut around the potentiometer shaft. If you need a thinner spacer, you can scale it in the z direction with your slicer software.
